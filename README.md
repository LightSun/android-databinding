## android-databinding
this framework is now can be used in your app. By test and test,by find bug and fix i think it is now can work with well. it helps you fast bind data and event. <b>Plugin and xml schema file for this framework can be used now. </b>

   <b>before build the sample project,you need to import the xml schema file of this databind framework, see it below.</b>
   see <b>[How to use plugin and xml schema ?]</b>

## Why I developed this ?
at google-io-2015. android databindingnow can be used, it have some problem, even if this is not the reason. because i think the engineer of google's is one of the  best of the world. so it can be better and better i believe.  I absolutely can not be compared with them. but i don't like to writing databinding expression in android layout file(in javaweb I hate it too ). so I developed 
this framework. 

## support plugin and xml schema
 android studio plugin and the xml schema of config file which are used for android-databinding framework is now available  .

## Features
- you can apply image property (round,borderColor,borderWidth,circle) by you like now.
  so to apply image property you must call like this. 
 ``` java
 DataBindingFactory.setImagePropertyApplier(new VolleyImageApplier()); //here i just use volley to load
 ```

- supported by plugin and xml schema file. 
- support for bind data and event handler by xml. but you must call bind method in java code.
- support for notify data change.
- Support for custom attr and listener
- support for bind adapter for any child of Adapter view  or RecyclerView
  ( contains multi items and multi select mode of adapter )
- support for bind image (like round/borderColor/borderWith/placeHolder/errorResId),see it bellow.
- The common support attrs: 

  ``` java
    //event name
    String ON_CLICK                =    "onClick";
    String ON_LONG_CLICK           =    "onLongClick";
    String TEXT_CHANGE_BEFORE      =    "textChange_before";
    String TEXT_CHANGE             =    "textChange";
    String TEXT_CHANGE_AFTER       =    "textChange_after";
    String ON_FOCUS_CHANGE         =    "onFocusChange";

    String ON_TOUCH                =    "onTouch";

    //common name
    String BACKGROUND              =    "background";       //drawable /color / res id
    String BACKGROUND_COLOR        =    "backgroundColor";
    String BACKGROUND_RES          =    "background_res";

    String TEXT                    =    "text";
    String TEXT_RES                =    "text_res";

    String TEXT_COLOR              =    "textColor";
    String TEXT_COLOR_RES          =    "textColor_res";
    String TEXT_COLOR_STATE        =    "textColor_state";
    String TEXT_COLOR_STATE_RES    =    "textColor_stateRes";
    String TEXT_SIZE               =    "textSize";
    String TEXT_SIZE_RES           =    "textSize_res";

    String VISIBILITY              =    "visibility";
    //image
    String IMGAE_URL               =    "img_url";
    String IMGAE_BITMAP            =    "img_bitmap";
    String IMGAE_DRAWABLE          =    "img_drawable";
    
   //ps:  and also support self-attrs 
  ```

- Support multi expressions. eg: java calling expression (only nested ternary expression is not support), 
   android resource reference expression {@drawable/ic_default} or R.drawable.ic_default , dp and sp like "15dp",
   and color like "#ff0000" and so on.
- <b>the image full config was supported  now (round/circle/borderWith/borderColor/placeHolder).</b>  
  here is the demo: 
  ``` java
   <bind id="eniv2">
        <property name="onClick" referVariable="eventHandler" > eventHandler.onClickImage()</property>
        <imageProperty type="round" referVariable="imageParam">  <!-- round / circle / oval -->
            <roundSize>{@dimen/corner_size}</roundSize>
            <borderWidth>5dp</borderWidth>
            <borderColor>#ff0000</borderColor>

            <url>imageParam.link</url>
            <default>{@drawable/ic_default}</default>     <!-- support drawable ,bitmap,  resource id -->
            <errorResId>R.drawable.ic_error</errorResId>  <!-- only support resource id -->

        </imageProperty>
    </bind>
  ```
